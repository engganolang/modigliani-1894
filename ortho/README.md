# Notes

The common orthography for Nias and Toba-Batak is still tentative. The common orthography for the Enggano forms attempts to follow that laid out in [this Excel spreadsheet](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/static/Enggano-transcriptions.xlsx) (from our Enggano [webpage](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/static/previous.html)), which is transformed into a long-table format [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dqSBmov1j5mlIhpbKp53BIh8iNVvFgJjWNi8ZcOgo8/edit?usp=sharing) using [this code](https://github.com/engganolang/enolex/blob/main/codes/r-code_02-orthography.R).

In the original word list table, these common orthography conversions are not yet included (so the table only holds the original orthography/spelling from Modigliani).
