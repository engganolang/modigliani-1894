# Notes

The common orthography for Nias and Toba-Batak is still tentative. The common orthography for the Enggano forms attempts to follow that laid out in [this Excel spreadsheet](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/static/Enggano-transcriptions.xlsx) (from our Enggano [webpage](https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/static/previous.html)), which is transformed into a long-table format [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dqSBmov1j5mlIhpbKp53BIh8iNVvFgJjWNi8ZcOgo8/edit?usp=sharing) using [this code](https://github.com/engganolang/enolex/blob/main/codes/r-code_02-orthography.R).

In the original word list table, these common orthography conversions are not yet included (so the table only holds the original orthography/spelling from Modigliani).

In the orthography file for each language, there may be empty cells under the `originals` column. This means that the language does not have the corresponding form (with reference to the Italian gloss). The column `..._COMMON` is the non-tokenised (i.e., non-white-spaced) version of the `..._TRANSLITERATED` column. Meanwhile, the `..._TOKENISED` is the tokenised/white-spaced version of the `originals` that has not been transliterated into the common orthography profile for Modigliani (1894).
